# Flutter Project files (created by flutter create, but we want to ignore them if we are generating them on CI)
# However, usually we DO commit the platform folders (android, ios, web, etc.) if we have custom native code.
# In this specific project, we are generating the project structure in CI, so we might not have these folders locally yet.
# But if the user runs flutter create locally, these will appear.
# Standard practice is to commit android/ ios/ etc.
# Since the user is working locally without Flutter installed, they might not generate these.
# But if they do, we should probably track them if they contain custom changes.
# Given the user's request "I don't have Android Studio locally", they probably won't generate platform folders.
# But if they do, standard gitignore applies.
